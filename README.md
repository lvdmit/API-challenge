# API-challenge

This project performs a weather analysis across 500 randomly selected cities. Weather data were requested using
Open Weather Map API. 
The initial hypothes was that there is a correlation between temperature, humidity, cloudness and wind speed and
latitude. The analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between temperature, and a weak correlation 
between humidity and latitude.

This project was completed using the pandas, Matplotlib, time, numpy,pprint and requests libraries, Jupiter
Notebook and Open Weather Map API.
